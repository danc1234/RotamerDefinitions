# Introduction to Rotamer Definitions
This introduction to rotamer definitions explores what makes up a dihedral angle, how to calculate one, and how one could use them to find a range of rotamers

## Notes on the .csv files

### Missing Amino Acids 
Amino acids are missing in the dihedral .csv files because those amino acids do not have long enough carbon chains to define chi-angles for those amino acids, especially for chi-angles 3, 4, and 5.

## Progress

### 10/30/25
Made the .csv files for Dihedral Angles 1 and 2. Starting with the code that will attempt to calculate a dihedral angle, given the coordinates of the atoms of an amino acid.

### 10/31/25
Finished making the Points class to allow one to calculate dihedral angles given 4 points. Also, given that value, assigns it as gauche plus, trans, or a gauche minus staggered conformational isomer. 

### 11/4/25
Finished updating .csv dihedral values.
