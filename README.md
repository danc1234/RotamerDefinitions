### Introduction to Rotamer Definitions
This introduction to rotamer definitions explores what makes up a dihedral angle, how to calculate one, and how one could use them to find a range of rotamers

## Notes on the .csv files

# Dihedral_Angle_one csv file
Alanine and Glycine are omitted from the files because the carbon chain length for these amino acids is less than 4. This means they only contain carbons C, CA, and CB.

# Dihedral_Angle_two csv file
**Added reason for omitting some amino acids later**

## Progress

# 10/30/25
Made the .csv files for Dihedral Angles 1 and 2. Starting on the code that will attempt to calculate a dihedral angle given the coordinates of the atoms of an amino acid.
